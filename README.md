# new-proj

An interview to Duda- Adi Gonnen.

This proj was created with Vue-Cli.
I got the data from api with axios in a service file.
Then I sent the data to the components, using promises in main component and props sent to child component.

## Project setup:
```
npm install
```

### Compiles:
```
npm run serve
```

### Load the page:
```
A new browser window with the address: localhost:8080

```
